## List of Fallacies:  
- Hasty Generalization:  
Saying that, 'Wealthy people of arrogant'. Some might and some may not be arrogant. So don't generalize hastily.

- Missing the point:  
  Saying, Drunk driving _could_ lead to death of innocent people so it must be punished with a death penality. Drunk driving _doesn't always_ lead to death. So, though it is a serious crime blindly stating 'death penality' is missing the point. The penality should be harsh but _may not_ be death penality.
  
- Post hoc:  
 After this, so because of this. For e.g. Raise in Interest rates and raise in number of violent crimes happening in a given year. Saying here, that raise of interest rates lead to violent crimes is Post hoc fallacy because, the violence has increased _after_ interest rate increase.
 
- Slippery slope:  
  Similar to post hoc but involves many events. For e.g. Saying that, use of animals for laboratory testing leads to loss of empathy in humans and this eventual loss will lead to violence.
  
- Weak analogy:  
  Unknowingly comparing apples with oranges; they are both frutis but no they are not same. Another example quoted is, both guns and hammers are made of metals that could kill people so saying that 'we don't ban hammers so why ban guns' is weak analogy because that a weak comparision. Guns can be easily used for afar for mass killings while use of hammer cannot be used for killing from distance.
  
- Appeal to authority:  
  Trying to use celebrity's/Authority's name and their expressed opposition to a particular event. for e.g death penality. Celebrities have no expertise on legal matters and their expression is emotional based and, should not be constituted to be authority on framing death penality rules.
  
- Ad Populum/Bandwagon:  
Appealing to popularism. E.g. “Gay marriages are just immoral. _70% of Americans think so!_”. Stating "70%" thinks in a way is trying to consciously bring popular opinion into discussion. It is saying that 'Popular ideas or actions should be correct; everyone cannot be wrong.'

- Ad hominem(to the person) and tu quoque(you too):  
Ad hominem is directing your arguments attacking the opponents character rather than their reasoning. E.g. Saying "He is an ugly guy, why would you listen to him ?". though his ugliness has no relation to his reasoning/logic.

tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy) is saying "you too did it (smoked cigarettes) when you are our age and now, you have problem when we are doing it (smoke now) ?" Now, the negative affects from smoking which the oppents (parents in this case) are trying to reason doesn't change just because the opponent also did it at some point in time.

- Appeal to pity:  
Using sympothy to win an argument. E.g. "I fell sick in the week leading to exams so I couldn't do well in exams"
