- Emotional Intelligence = Emotional Recognition (self understanding) + Emotional Management *+* Emotional Recognition (of other people) + Emotional Influence (of others)

- Emotional Recognition: Being self-aware of things driving you nuts Or making you feel good
- Emotional Management: Understanding the impact of emotions on one-self and taking appropriate control actions
- Emotional Connection: Connecting and Influencing others positively through emotional management

** Intentions Vs Impact:
- Your actions could be well intenteded but, their resulting impact on others could be negative
- Others percieve you basing on the impact not on your intentions

** When dumbstuck:
  1. Stop, (By changing your body language to relaxed state; Your body language does influence your thinking)
  2. Take a deep breath, (Slowdown; it helps your heart ;) )
  3. Seek more information; This can be done by repeating the question Or reiterating understanding of the situation to give one-self ample enough time to think
  
  /( Don't Rush, Don't jump to address/answer -- Very very hard to implement in reality but persist through trying )/
  
  
- Emotional Connection: Understanding other persons perspective genuinely; 
/(Its always better to understand other person and discuss walking side by side than to burn the bridge proving yourself to be right)/

* Humans are creatures of emotions more than creatures of logic.
