## 5 Universal laws of Human Stupidity:

- Humanity’s greatest existential threat: Stupidity

#### share several identifying traits: 
They are: 
1. abundant, 
2. they are irrational, 
3. and they cause problems for others without apparent benefit to themselves, thereby lowering society’s total well-being

__Law 1__: Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.  
__Law 2__: The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.  
__Law 3__: A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.  
__Law 4__: Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.  
__Law 5__: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.  

A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.

We can do nothing about the stupid. The difference between societies that collapse under the weight of their stupid citizens and those who transcend them are the makeup of the non-stupid. Those progressing in spite of their stupid possess a high proportion of people acting intelligently, those who counterbalance the stupid’s losses by bringing about gains for themselves and their fellows.

Declining societies have the same percentage of stupid people as successful ones. But they also have high percentages of helpless people and, Cipolla writes, “an alarming proliferation of the bandits with overtones of stupidity.”

“Such change in the composition of the non-stupid population inevitably strengthens the destructive power of the [stupid] fraction and makes decline a certainty,” Cipolla concludes. “And the country goes to Hell.”
