Streetepistemology(SE)

Epistemology is the study of knowledge. What we know, how we know it, how we know we know it, and how to keep track of it without driving ourselves crazy.

Street here is just that the presenter does this discussion with people on street.

### Objective is:
* To understand how did one reach a conclusion ? How they got to that conclusion ??
* Atleast make the other person think on the beliefs they got fixated to. So people are really dogmatic, we must accept it. The argument in this case could endup in ad hominem. So understand "You objective is not winning your argument over the other person's"

## Three most important elements in discussion:
- Person, Method, Conclusion.
- Person: Tone of voice, body language, relaxed state or agitated or nervous
- Method: Question oriented discussion, relaxed exchange of statements, Shouting match
- Conclusion: Discussion helped the person's to think logically of their beliefs, person agrees with you

## Logical thinking steps:
- How did you figure that out ?
- Is that method reliable ?
- How can we test that ?
- What's a good way to reach that conclusion ?

## General Questions:
- Anything What do you strongly believe in Or very confident about ?
- On a scale of 10 Or in percentage how sure you are in your belief Or how confident your belief is true ?
- What got you to that level (e.g. 90% confidence) in your belief or conclusion ?
- Could that method ever lead to false conclusions ?
- Is there a better way to reach that conclusion than personal experience ?
- Would different personal experiences affect your belief ?
- Clarification questions:
  - What do you mean by that ?
  - Rephrase their point and repeat it as a question. Like say "So what i understand from your point is that, lion is really the king of jungle, right ?"
  - Could you elaborate ?
  - If science is limited, what is the foundation of your belief ? If they say "I have faith on the god basing on which I derive my conclusion", look below question.
  - What do you mean by faith Or What 'faith' means to you ?
  - Is faith a reliable way to reach a true conclusion ?
  - Relying on faith, can two person come to same conclusion ?
  - Can each person have their own faith's but not reach same conclusion ? My faith is non-existance of god, while your faith is in existence of god. So by relying on faith can we reach to a conclusion ?
  - Are there more reliable ways than relying on just faith ?
  - What other ways or foundations you could have come to your conclusion/belief ?
  - The book or person(s) may not be lying but that's really could be a low bar of evidence ? So, do we have anything that raises that bar with evidence and which could make us truly believe ?

## Important points:
- Start with asking how they would rate their belief and understanding on scale of 1 to 10 Or like in percent.
- Concrete number helps us understand how truly sure/confident the other person is in their belief and understanding.
- Watch your tone; Shouting only makes other person defensive and dig-in on their point with the intent to defend and save their face, though they know their point could be wrong. They would become dogmatic.
- Never target the person Or their belief, they could take as challenging them and it could lead to other person becoming adamant and deaf to your points, as they become defensive
