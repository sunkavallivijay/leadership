** Knower Vs Learner:
* Knower:
- Knower makes conclusive statements e.g. That wont work we tried/know it.
- Here is what we should do
- If we do X then Y-Bad thing- will happen

* Learner:
- Asks open questions e.g. How can we make it happen ?
- What do you think we should do ?
- What I want is X and What I dont want is Y.

Repharse your statements: 
- "Here is what we should do" to *What should we do?* <- simple shifting of the world position to make it a question.
- Keep statements open so that others may add their suggestions to help create solution

Change statements:
  'We Cant' to 'How to.. ?'
  'No.' to 'I wish..'
  'But' to 'Yes and..'
  
  *Minds are like parachutes; they only function when open.* and *Follow this at home too and everywhere in fact for a better life*
